# Muscu
A prototype of workout planning mobile application

Please install these dependencies:

npm install --save axios

npm install --save redux react-redux

npm install --save firebase

npm install --save redux-thunk

npm install --save react-native-router-flux@3.35.0

npm install --save lodash

Since this app was developed in December 2016, the new updates of the dependecies might cause some errors. 
Here are the versions that I used at that time:

"dependencies": {

    "axios": "^0.15.2",

    "firebase": "^3.6.1",

    "lodash": "^4.17.2",
    
    "react": "15.4.1",
    
    "react-native": "0.38.0",
    
    "react-native-check-box": "^1.0.2",
    
    "react-native-hyperlink": "0.0.7",
    
    "react-native-router-flux": "^3.35.0",
    
    "react-native-swiper": "^1.5.4",
    
    "react-redux": "^4.4.6",
    
    "redux": "^3.6.0",

 }
